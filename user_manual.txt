WELCOME TO B.O.O.K.A.H.
(Build Optimization & Organization for Knowledge-Agnostic Hominids)

==============================================================================
WHAT IS THIS?
==============================================================================
This is a smart assistant for creating Guild Wars 1 builds. Unlike standard 
template editors, Bookah uses Artificial Intelligence to suggest skills that 
work well with what you've already picked. It learns from thousands of 
player-created builds to help you find synergy.

==============================================================================
QUICK START
==============================================================================
1. Run 'Bookah.exe'.
2. Drag skills from the list on the left to the empty slots on your bar.
3. Watch as the empty slots automatically fill with AI suggestions!
4. Double-click a skill in the list to auto-equip it to the first empty slot.

==============================================================================
MAIN FEATURES
==============================================================================

1. INTELLIGENT SUGGESTIONS
   As you add skills, the AI suggests what to add next.
   - Standard Mode (Default): Suggests skills that are historically popular 
     with your current choices.
   - Smart Mode: Turns on the advanced "Mechanics Engine". It reads 
     skill descriptions to find combos you might miss and checks if you forgot 
     basics like a Self-Heal or Energy Management.

2. SEARCH & FILTERS
   - Text Box: Search by skill name.
   - "Description" Checkbox: Check this to search inside the skill text instead 
     of the name (e.g., search "burning" to find skills that cause burning).
   - "Pre" Checkbox: Hides all skills that are not available in Pre-Searing.
   - "PvP" Checkbox: Switches to PvP versions of skills and hides PvE-only ones.

4. TEAM SYNERGY MODE (Green Button)
   Want to fit into a team?
   1. Click "Manage Teams" to create or import a team build.
   2. Check "Smart Mode" to see the "Load Teambuild to Bar" button.
   3. Click it and select your team.
   4. The AI will now suggest skills that combo with your teammates (like 
      attacking burning foes if your ally causes burning).

5. ATTRIBUTE EDITOR
   On the right side, you can adjust your attribute points. The editor uses 
   real Guild Wars math (costs increase as you rank up). It also supports 
   PvE ranks like Sunspear or Lightbringer.

6. IS THIS UNIQUE?
   Click this button to compare your finished bar against thousands of known 
   meta-builds. It will tell you if you've accidentally reinvented the wheel 
   or created something truly original.

BUTTONS EXPLAINED
==============================================================================
[Cycle Suggestions] : Don't like the AI's top pick? Click this to rotate 
                      through other good options for your empty slots.

[Lock]              : Freezes the current suggestions so they don't change 
                      while you are browsing or thinking.

[Manage Teams]      : Opens a window to import team builds (you can drag and 
                      drop a folder of templates here!).

[Select Template Folder] : Tells the app where your Guild Wars templates are 
                           stored so you can export directly to the game.

==============================================================================
TIPS & TRICKS
==============================================================================
* Right-click a skill on your bar to remove it.
* Hover over any suggested skill (ghost icon) to see WHY the AI suggested it.
* If you select a Zone or Team, you can click the colored button again to 
  turn that mode off and return to normal building.

==============================================================================
WARNINGS
==============================================================================
* ⚠️ High Drain: Triggered if the total energy drain per second (EPS) exceeds 4.0 for casters or 2.5 for others.
* ⚠️ Heavy Burst: Triggered if a two-skill combo costs more than 80% of your maximum energy capacity.
* Weapon Conflict: (Preventative) Blocks suggestions that require a different weapon type than what's already locked on your bar.
* Stance Clog: (Preventative) Prevents suggesting a stance if you already have a stance active (since most don't stack).
* Combo Invalid: (Preventative) Prevents suggesting a "Dual Attack" if you don't have a "Lead" or "Off-hand" to trigger it.
* Suicide Loop: (Preventative) Prevents suggesting skills that cost so much health (Sacrifice) that you would kill yourself within a standard rotation.
* Burst > Capacity: (Preventative) Blocks skills that cost more energy than your maximum possible pool.
